# C Pool - 42 Angouleme

Here are the projects that I completed during the C pool of 42 AngoulÃªme. This intensive program allowed me to discover and master the C programming language through a series of practical projects named "days".
I had never coded in C before this pool and was able to advance in these projects and reach this final result thanks to the knowledge of mathematics that I had acquired during my previous studies, my curiosity, mutual help and my zeal.

## Objectives of the Pool

The C pool aims to:
- Introduce participants to the fundamentals of the C language.
- Develop problem-solving and algorithmic skills.
- Encourage collaborative learning and autonomy.


## Shell

Those two days are focused on understanding how a shell operates.
