# C Pool - 42 Angouleme

Here are the projects that I completed during the C pool of 42 Angoulême. This intensive one-month program allowed me to discover and master the C programming language through a series of practical projects called "Days".

I had never coded in C before this pool and was able to advance in these projects and reach this final result thanks to the knowledge of mathematics that I had acquired during my previous studies, my curiosity, mutual help and my zeal.

## Objectives of the Pool

The C pool aims to:
- Introduce participants to the fundamentals of the C language.
- Develop problem-solving and algorithmic skills.
- Encourage collaborative learning and autonomy.


## Shell

Those two first Days are focused on understanding how a Shell operates.
I would recommend you to spend maximum three days on these Days in order to understand the basis of Shell and quickly move on the C part.

## C
There are 14 projects in total and I achieved 07 of them.
I preferred to do my projects well and push them to the max rather than doing the bare minimum and going far in the Days. This strategy allowed me to better deal with each Rush and Exams.

## Rush
The Rush tests our ability to solve problems in a group. They last 48 hours (on weekends) and the teams are formed randomly.

### Rush00
This Rush was fun, it allowed me to better understand how the 'while' loops work. The code was functional but we made a small mistake of inattention that lead us to this 10% result (we forgot to put the files in a folder 'ex00').

## Rush01
This Rush was hard, I had the lead of the team so I learned how to manage a group. We couldn’t make a fully functional program so we decided to switch to hard code mode. Thanks to this rudimentary solution we managed to get a good 70%.

## Rush02
This Rush was interesting, I learned how to do and use a Makefile. We had a good group that communicated well so we managed to go through the Rush despite the difficulty and the lack of knowledge.
